# Test-Suitmedia
This repository contains an internship test run at Suitmedia, where I created an application that can check whether a word or sentence is a palindrome. Apart from that, this application is also able to display a data set from a given API.

The main features of this application are:

- Palindrome Check: Applications can receive word or sentence input from the user and identify whether the input is a palindrome.
  Display Data from API: Apps can fetch data from a given API and display it to the user.

- By using this application, users can easily check whether a word or sentence is a palindrome and see the data set from the available API.

This repository contains the application implementation that I have worked on as part of the internship test at Suitmedia.
